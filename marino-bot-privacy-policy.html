  Marino Bot â€“ Privacy Policy
  Last Updated: April 20, 2025
  
  This Privacy Policy explains what information Marino Bot ("the Bot", "we", "us") collects, how it's used, and your rights regarding your data.
  
  By using Marino Bot in your Discord server or as a user, you agree to this policy.
  
  1. What Information We Collect
  Marino Bot collects and processes minimal data needed to function properly. This may include:
  
  Message content: Only when using the quote feature.
  
  Usernames / User IDs: Only when quoting or when interacting with bot commands.
  
  Search queries: When you use the lyrics feature to fetch a song from Genius.com.
  
  We do not collect or store:
  
  Direct Messages (DMs)
  
  Passwords or sensitive information
  
  Audio, images, or video content
  
  Location data
  
  2. How We Use Your Data
  We use the data strictly to:
  
  Process user commands (quoting, lyrics search)
  
  Improve the functionality and reliability of the bot
  
  Respond to user inputs in real time
  
  None of the data is stored long-term unless explicitly required for a feature (e.g., optional quote history, if implemented and enabled).
  
  3. Data Storage & Retention
  Marino Bot does not store data persistently by default.
  
  If quote history or caching is enabled (in the future), users will be notified and server admins will have the ability to opt out or delete stored data. Any temporarily cached data is deleted automatically after a short period.
  
  4. Sharing of Data
  We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
  
  The bot interacts with external services such as:
  
  Genius.com (to retrieve song lyrics)
  
  We only send necessary search queries to retrieve data and do not share any user-specific information with them.
  
  5. Your Rights & Control
  You have the right to:
  
  Request deletion of any stored data (if applicable)
  
  Opt out of data storage features (if offered in the future)
  
  Contact us with privacy questions or concerns
  
  Server administrators can remove Marino Bot at any time, which will cease all interaction and clear any temporary data.
  
  6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
  Marino Bot is intended for use by Discord users who are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe weâ€™ve inadvertently collected such data, please contact us immediately.
  
  7. Updates to This Policy
  This Privacy Policy may be updated over time. We will notify users of significant changes via the bot or support channels. Continued use of the bot means you accept any changes.

  Let me know if your bot logs quotes persistently, has a dashboard, or allows users to save content, and I can revise this to fit that setup.

  Got it! Hereâ€™s the updated Privacy Policy with a section that explains quotes are saved to the botâ€™s host computer. This helps make it clear where the data is being stored and how long it may persist.

  Last Updated: [Insert Date]
  
  This Privacy Policy explains what information Marino Bot ("the Bot", "we", "us") collects, how itâ€™s used, and your rights regarding your data. By using Marino Bot in your Discord server or as a user, you agree to this policy.

  Marino Bot collects and processes the following minimal data required to provide its core functionalities:
  
  Message content: Only when using the quote feature.

  Location data
  
  2. How We Use Your Data
  We use the collected data for the following purposes:
  
  Quoting Feature: To store and retrieve quotes that users request, so they can be accessed later in the same server.
  
  Lyrics Feature: To fetch song lyrics via Genius.com using search queries submitted by users.
  
  Bot Functionality: To ensure that the bot operates correctly and responds to user inputs in real-time.
  
  3. Data Storage & Retention
  Quote Data Storage: When you use the quoting feature, the quotes are saved temporarily to the hostâ€™s computer/server. This data is not stored in any centralized database and is accessible only on the host's machine. Quotes may persist across restarts or sessions unless manually deleted by the bot administrator.
  
  Data Retention: Quote data will remain on the host's computer until the botâ€™s server is restarted or the data is manually cleared. There is no long-term data retention unless specified by the bot administrator.
  
  If the bot offers a feature to delete or manage saved quotes, users will be notified, and the server administrator will have control over managing stored data.
  
  4. Sharing of Data
  We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
  The bot interacts with external services such as:
  
  Genius.com (for retrieving song lyrics). Only search queries are sent to Genius.com, and no other user data is shared with them.
  
  Your personal information is not shared with any third-party services except as necessary to provide the botâ€™s features (e.g., fetching lyrics from Genius.com).
  
  5. Your Rights & Control
  You have the following rights regarding your data:
  
  Request Data Deletion: If the quoting feature is enabled, you may request that quotes be deleted from the hostâ€™s system. Server administrators can also clear quotes at any time.
  
  Opt-out of Data Storage: If quote data storage is optional, you can opt-out of this feature.
  
  Access and Control: As a user or server administrator, you can delete any saved quote data manually or disable the quoting feature altogether.
  
  Server administrators can remove Marino Bot at any time, which will cease all interactions and clear any temporary data.
